# Titanic-Kaggle-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Algorithm
EMAIL:sharvilt1769@gmail.com

With the Help of kaggle i exported csv into my R studio

Split the data into trained and test data given that the survival status of the test data was not known

I cleaned both the data sets followed by appying random forest regression whose accuracy increased drastically as seen in 
CSV image-Random Forest Accuracy Graph

This was done by steping up mtry at every iteration to ensure increase in accuracy and by limiting every step to meet a certain OOB Barometer

I also parsed the tree to infer upon each variables contribution to this regression

CSV Folder contains the prediction inferred by Random forest Regression

Initial Data is the data to begin with provided by kaggle
